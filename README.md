## Overview

The **Band Name Generator** is a simple yet creative project designed to help users generate unique band names. By prompting the user for two inputsâ€”**the city they grew up in** and **the name of their pet**â€”the program combines these inputs to create a catchy and personalized band name.

This project is perfect for beginners learning Python, as it demonstrates basic concepts like user input, string manipulation, and output formatting.

## Features

- **Interactive Command-Line Interface**: Simple prompts guide users through the process.
- **Dynamic Band Name Generation**: Combines user-provided data (city and pet name) to create unique band names.
- **Lightweight and Portable**: Runs on any system with Python installed.
- **Beginner-Friendly Code**: Ideal for those learning Python basics, such as `input()`, string concatenation, and printing.
